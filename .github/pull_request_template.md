If you're adding a project to the Python 3 statement, please ensure you have:

- [ ] Discussed dropping Python 2 support with all maintainers
- [ ] Discussed signing the statement with all maintainers
- [ ] Added a suitable logo if the project has one
  - [ ] Approximately square logos generally fit better than banners
  - [ ] Compressed the logo to save bandwidth (run `scripts/squash-images.sh` on it)
- [ ] Checked the Netlify preview made from the pull request
