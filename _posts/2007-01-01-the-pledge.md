# In Progress

## This is the current text of the pledge, it is not final and still in discussion.

## Your feedback is welcomed.


Python 3 is the future of the Python language.
Python 3 is nicer to work with than Python 2.7, making code maintenance easier.
Python 3 also allows for some feature possibilities that Python 2 simply doesn't allow for.
Unfortunately, many projects still support both Python 2 and 3 which is its own development burden.
Supporting Python 2 can also hold a project back from supporting features only possible in Python 3.

For all of these reasons, the following projects have pledged to **drop support for Python 2.7 no later than 2020**,
coinciding with the Python development team's [timeline for dropping support for Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update).
