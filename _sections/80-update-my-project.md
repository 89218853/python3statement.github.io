# Update your project to be Python 3 only

While most of the project that have signed up above are migrating to Python 3
only code base, we are gathering information about the difficulties that can be
encountered both by developers and users during this process. 

We are thus collecting a list of things to be aware of for the transition to be
as seem less as possible. For example : as a developer, how to make sure that
package manager like pip do not upgrade you your libraries to incompatible
versions on Python 2. Check [our
repository](https://github.com/python3statement/python3statement.github.io) for
more informations.
