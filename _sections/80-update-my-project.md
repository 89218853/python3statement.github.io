# Practicalities

While most of the projects that have signed up above are migrating to Python 3
only code bases, we are gathering information about the difficulties that can be
encountered both by developers and users during this process. 

We are thus collecting a list of things to be aware of for when transitioning that
are less obvious. For example : as a developer, how to make sure that
your package manager like pip does not upgrade your libraries to incompatible
versions on Python 2. Check [our
repository](https://github.com/python3statement/python3statement.github.io) for
more information.
