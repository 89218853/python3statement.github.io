#   Projects Timeline

In the following chart, you can see many projects that have decided to stop
supporting Python 2 before 2020. The chart is a guideline to show what
versions of each project support Python 2, or not, their release timelines, and
extended support. (Python's own timeline is available
[here](https://docs.python.org/devguide/#status-of-python-branches)).

See how to [add  your project to the list of participating projects](https://github.com/python3statement/python3statement.github.io#add-your-project) and to [this timeline](https://github.com/python3statement/python3statement.github.io#add-timeline-information)
